				<h3 class="author"><em>by</em> Klaas Pieter Annema</h3>
				<p class="intro">This is the last week of my internship at Sofa. What better way to summarize what I&#39;ve learned than in a blog post?</p>
				
				
			</div>
			<div class="right_col">
				<p>Nine months ago I started my internship here at Sofa. My assignment was to create an iPhone application. It took me one month to create a working application without a proper user interface. So I was almost done&hellip; Right? You probably know that Sofa&#39;s user interface quality standards are high, but how long do you think it takes to adhere to them? I&#39;ve started my internship nine months ago and I can&#39;t talk about what I did, because it&#39;s still not done!</p>

<h2>User Interfaces</h2>
<p>So I learned not to underestimate the user interface. Yes, but I also learned something way more important. Before I started at Sofa I knew about the importance of user interfaces, but somehow, I never applied this knowledge. To me user interfaces were a necessary evil; something a product needed to have to show off all the incredibly complex features I implemented.</p>

<p>I learned that a user interface should never reflect the complexity of a feature directly. As a programmer, I wanted users to acknowledge the amount of work I put into a feature. I abused the user interface to show this complexity and hoped the user would recognize and appreciate my work.</p>

<p>A user does not see the complexity of a feature, not even if you make using it as hard as implementing it. I always show stuff I&#39;m excited about to my fiancee. Somehow, she never is quite as excited as I am. She, like most non-technical users, just doesn&#39;t see the complexity.</p>

<p>Users don&#39;t care about the complexity of features, they want software to work in ways they expect. When a user interface visualizes complex features in easy to use ways, people will enjoy using your product and get excited about it. Which brings me to the next thing I learned.</p>

<h2>The One Rule</h2>
<p>There are a lot of applications out there that aren&#39;t fun to use. Don&#39;t developers use their own products? I don&#39;t know, but I think they should. If developers aren&#39;t familiar with the problem they&#39;re solving, how do you think they can solve it? All of Sofa&#39;s applications follow a simple rule: Create software that solves problems you understand and care about.</p>

<p>This is, I think, one of the biggest advantages of working in a small company. Everyone at Sofa shares the same vision about software; we want to create beautiful, stunning and easy to use products. Of course, there are big companies that build software in a similar spirit, but regrettably, most don&#39;t. This is no surprise, since managing this becomes harder as the number of employees increase.</p>

<h2>David vs. Goliath</h2>
<p>During my internship at Sofa, a lot of my opinions and prejudices slowly changed. I&#39;ve already talked about my huge transition from a UI-indifferent Windows programmer to an interface-centered iPhone developer. Another prejudice that slowly changed, was how I felt about working at a smaller company.</p>

<p>Before Sofa, I always pictured myself working in a large company. I can&#39;t recall my exact reasoning, but I think the thing I wanted most was a successful career, stepping up the corporate ladder as quickly as possible and giving leadership to increasingly more random people. Random because I probably didn&#39;t hire them. Random because they probably wouldn&#39;t share my (or each others) vision about software development.</p>

<p>I probably wouldn&#39;t have gotten much fun or satisfaction from such a career. On top of that, I was excited about the wrong aspect of it. I wasn&#39;t excited about developing great products, I was excited about being as high-up and important as possible. And yes, probably about the salary that comes with those positions as well. I don&#39;t want to imply that such a position (and its paycheck) can&#39;t be fun, challenging or exciting. I&#39;m just saying that I was excited about everything but creating great software.</p>

<p>Now onto something I <em>am</em> excited about.</p>

<h2>I Got the Job!</h2>
<p>The second my opinions about smaller companies started to change, my goals started to change as well. I wanted <strong>this</strong> job. And I got lucky; Sofa offered it to me on one condition, the same one that applied to my internship: I was not allowed to pack my own lunch ;). So now I travel two hours to get to work and two hours to get back home every day. Why? Because I am excited about creating beautiful, stunning and easy to use products!</p>

<h2>Finishing Up</h2>
<p>I learned a lot more than this, but the above three things were by far the most important. If my post inspired you <em>and</em> you want to write just such a post after some intense pixel perfect programming, send an email to <a href='mailto:<script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"xbra\100znqrolfbsn\056pbz".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c){return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
</script>'>Koen</a> or <a href='mailto:<script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"qvex\100znqrolfbsn\056pbz".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c){return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
</script>'>Dirk</a> and they&#39;ll get back to you.</p>
