				<p>At Sofa, everybody designs. Whether you&#39;re pushing pixels, modding view controllers, or balancing accounts, there&#39;s always a better way. We&#39;re looking for creative perfectionists with a tad of pragmatism, because eventually, we do need to ship that&nbsp;1.0.</p>
				<p>You&#39;ll work with a select crew of highly talented people. Whether you have decades of experience or are just starting out, your opinion matters. We don&#39;t like meetings, but we sure do talk a&nbsp;lot.</p>
				
				<p>We are always looking for new talent. If you&#39;d like to work here but don&#39;t see a vacancy that suits you, don&#39;t hesitate to contact us with your motivation and resum&eacute; or portfolio.</p>

				<p class="intro">We focus on making beautiful, useful software. Everybody at Sofa shares this passion; that creates a unique atmosphere.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right_col">
				<p>Sofa is big enough to have an impact, and small enough to get things done, without office politics. We believe that the best ideas surface at the most unexpected moments, so we work hard to maintain an environment where they won&#39;t pass by&nbsp;unnoticed.</p>
				<p>Our office consists of two connected open spaces, each with about 6 desks, and a separate room for meetings and daily free lunches. Beyond those lunches, we&#39;ll provide you with good equipment, excellent coffee and tea, the occasional backyard BBQ, and plenty of interesting work. Fridays are casual, just like the rest of the week. If you&#39;re really lucky, you might even get some love from our office&nbsp;cat.</p>
				<p>We care deeply about the quality of literally everything we do, and we don&#39;t think much of formalities or convention. Sofa is a healthy, debt-free startup with real revenues and no outside investors. All decicions are made by the people you work with every&nbsp;day.</p>

				<p class="intro">Sofa needs creative team players with an itch to create something amazing.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right_col">
				<p>You are driven and self-motivated, and you need your work to engage you intellectually. Challenging the status quo is your second nature &ndash; good enough is never good enough. You have a wide range of interests and talents, but you&#39;re not full of yourself. You respect other people&#39;s opinions but aren&#39;t afraid to speak your mind. Getting every little detail just right is something you do for fun, but you won&#39;t let the big picture slip out of sight&nbsp;either.</p>
				<p>To work at Sofa, you&#39;ll need excellent written and verbal communication skills. English is the lingua franca, being a native speaker is a plus. Proficiency in Dutch is &ndash; except when listed for a specific vacancy &ndash; not a&nbsp;requirement.</p>
				<p>All vacancies are for full-time positions at our Amsterdam office. If you don&#39;t live in or close to Amsterdam, you have to be willing to relocate. It helps a lot if you&#39;re already legally able to work in&nbsp;Europe.</p>
